learn the right way to ask for feedback

from audiences about your speeches your

presentations because there is a wrong

way the wrong way is to say hey what did

you think what did you think of my

speech or presentation if you ask the

question that way people are likely to

say oh you did fine you did a good job

you look like a real Pro all of that

information is 100% worthless that's not

what you want to ask instead ask people

after you've given a presentation

what did you remember from my

presentation how would you explain what

I talked about today to a colleague who

couldn't be here CU they were in a

traffic jam that's when you really want

to listen that's the real value because

if they tell you specific stories that

you mention that they remember that's

valuable if there are specific ideas

that came to life because of the

examples you gave that's really valuable

now I ask audiences that all the time

and if someone says to me TJ you really

came across professional smooth polished

if that's what they say then I know my

speech was a complete utter failure you

don't want people talking about your

style you don't want them really even

talking about you you want them talking

about the ideas you put out there that

help them that changed them that

transformed them so please I beg you

next time you give a presentation or a

talk or even you practice on video and

you to show it to someone ask them what

they remember and you know what let me

practice what I'm preaching right now

please in the comments below tell me

what you remember from this presentation

tell me anything you take
