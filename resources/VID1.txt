hi guys do you have time for a few quick

questions I see you're having a lot of

fun but do you ever stop and think if

what you do is sustainable and do you

know what sustainable development

means sustainable development is to make

the world a better place for everyone

now without destroying the possibilities

for the next

Generations if you wonder if something

is sustainable you can ask as yourself

can we do this over and over again

forever sustainable development means

that we need to keep three things in

mind at once social progress Economic

Development and climate and

[Music]

environment first of all we have to take

care of our

planet we have many natural ecosystems

that must be in balance in order for us

to live

here the climate system is one of them

this system ensures that the temperature

is correct and that the atmosphere emits

exactly the right amount of solar energy

when we emit harmful greenhouse gases

such as CO2 we clog the atmosphere this

changes the temperatures in Earth which

again affects our developments how we

produce and use energy is incredibly

important oil and coal are examples of

energy we may run out of water wind and

Sun however will always be here using

the lasting sources of energy that renew

themselves is good for the planet and

can provide jobs for years to

[Music]

come

economics almost everything we develop

buy and trade starts with

nature the smarter we use our natural

resources and the better systems we

create for a fair distribution the more

sustainable we are one way to contribute

to a moreeven distribution is to be more

aware of what we buy and how it is

produced a football is a good example it

travels far before it reaches the

football players first the materials are

made then they print the logo somewhere

else before a third country sees it all

together one single football sees the

whole world before it reaches its goal

this journey ties us together if we are

to win the battle for a sustainable

future we have to play with Fair rules

that applies to

[Music]

everyone social progress we humans are

part of nature but we're also important

resources for the world just like water

the forest and the sun we have Minds

that can create the strangest and most

creative things but for us to be the

best versions of ourselves there are

certain things that must be in order

like having equal opportunities to

education safety food and medicine this

provides greater opportunities for us as

human beings but also for the planet we

just have to think a new ways these

three must work together that is

sustainable development and there is

actually a plan for this all the

countries of the United Nations have

agreed on a joint plan for sustainable

development but for the plan to work we

need to cooperate and we need you to be

on board are you with

us
