- You're gonna learn all
about active listening skills.

This is part two in a four-part series.

Listening is so important

because it's the most
direct way we connect

with other people and build relationships.

This channel is all about communicating

in professional settings,
but good listening

will help you strengthen your connection

with people in your personal
and family life as well.

The easiest way to get a picture

of what active listening looks, sounds,

and feels like is to contrast
it with passive listening.

And you've probably been on
the receiving end of this.

You're talking to somebody

and the other person might
technically be hearing

some of the information you're saying,

but they come across as tuned out.

They're on autopilot.

They're not engaging much with

what you're saying either
verbally or non-verbally.

And when you're in the role
of speaker in these moments,

this can be very dissatisfying,

disconfirming, and discouraging.

It can make you wonder

why you're talking in the first place.

And contrast, active
listening looks, sounds

and feels obvious.

Active listening means
listening completely.

We'll talk more specifics about
active listening behaviors

in a moment, but I believe
there are two prerequisites

that the best active listeners fulfill.

One prerequisite is that you
have to commit to listening.

That means you have to
put aside whatever else

might be distracting you.

You have to make the other
person your top priority.

I mention this as a prerequisite

because I have frequently
talked to clients

who tell me they're just
not good at listening.

The first question I ask them
is, "Have you truly committed

to being a good listener?"

And when they're honest, they'll usually

say, "Well, not really."

And that's usually why they're
not really a good listener.

They just wanna be
automatically good at listening

without making a genuine commitment to it,

without making it a priority
in every conversation.

Good listening is first
and foremost a choice

that you make every time
someone else speaks.

The second prerequisite is to accept

that good listening takes practice.

Listening is a skill like any other skill.

Practice is what makes you improve.

It's not automatic.

You have to work at it.

On the plus side, basic
active listening skills

are not mysterious or complex.

The four tips I'll give you in a moment

may seem like common
sense, but in that light,

the question for you is not,

do you understand these tips?

The question is, are you
doing them consistently?

First, active listening involves
nonverbal communication,

and there's two sides to this.

On the one hand, you're
demonstrating that you're engaged

and paying attention non-verbally.

I saw a bad example of this
on a TV show the other day

where there's a leader on
the show who has a reputation

for not caring about people.

One of his employees
walked into his office

and the boss continued writing an email,

kept his shoulders turned
away from the employee,

and made only glancing eye contact.

In contrast, one

of my past supervisors
was a great listener.

The first thing he would do
when you walked into his office

was to push away from his computer.

If he happened to have his phone out,

he would immediately silence
it and put it out of sight.

He did the exact opposite
of the guy on the TV show.

If you can do this, it'll
allow you to make good,

comfortable eye contact.

Your body posture should be open

and your shoulder should be
oriented toward the other person

On the other side of the coin,

good listeners also notice
the speaker's nonverbal cues

in return.

There's an expression that you listen

with your eyes, and part
of that is eye contact,

but the other part is you pay attention

and notice what's happening
with the other person visually.

What kind of mood are they in?

Do they look anxious, frustrated, annoyed?

You can pick up on that

by actively observing
their nonverbal cues.

Second, active listening
involves verbal communication.

Again, there are two sides to this.

The most obvious part is
asking good questions.

The most common pattern that
good listeners demonstrate

is that they ask a good question

and then they let the other
person fully answer it.

Picture a good mental health therapist.

They are the best listeners.

They ask you a thoughtful question

and then they stop talking for a while

and listen carefully
as their clients speak.

In a personal and professional
situation, you may notice

that a conversation will
seem to just die suddenly,

people just stop talking and
you don't know what to say.

The most common cause of this is that one

or more of the people in the conversation

stopped asking questions.

So asking questions and
listening is one half

of the verbal communication process

we use for good listening.

The other part of verbal communication

is those small utterances
that show the other person

that we're following them.

Good listeners demonstrate
they're listening

with what we call back channel cues.

They say, "I hear you."
"Yeah."

"Makes sense"

They're providing positive
verbal feedback that signals

to the speaker that
they're following along.

Often listeners won't even use full words.

They might just say,
"Hmm", "Ah", "Uh huh",

and we call these back channel cues

because they only last a brief moment,

and those utterances
don't really represent

a full talking turn.

If someone says, "U huh",

it doesn't feel like an interruption,

it feels like it's
happening in the background

while the main speaker's
words stay in the foreground

or in the main channel of communication.

But those little utterances
do a lot of work.

They keep you actively
engaged as a listener.

They show the other person
that you're following them.

So second, good verbal
communication while listening means

asking good questions
and then communicating

with back channel cues
while you pay attention.

Third, active listening
involves responding

to what the person just said.

This is part of what some people
call reflective listening,

and this goes beyond the basic utterances

or back channel cues I just mentioned.

The pattern starts like this.

You ask a question, the
other person responds

for however long it
takes, and then at the end

of that talking turn, you
give an informed response.

Let's say you just asked a person,

"What have you been working on lately?"

They tell you that they've been
drafting a big presentation.

That's a stretch for them,
but they're excited about it.

You actively listen for a while,

and then at the end of that talking turn,

it's your turn to talk again.

This is where you can reflect back to them

what you just heard.

You might say something
like "That sounds exciting"

or "That's great that
you're stretching yourself."

You are reflecting back a quick summary

of what they've just told you.

This makes this speaker
feel heard and appreciated.

We'll talk more about reflective listening

in part four of this series.

When we get to empathetic
listening skills.

Another way to respond is by
asking a follow-up question.

I didn't realize you were
doing presentations like that.

How did you get that opportunity?

Most good listeners do
both on their talking turn,

they use a mixture of
reflective statements

and follow-up questions.

In contrast, what you don't wanna do

is just look at them blankly

and not react when they're done talking.

Maybe people have done this to you.

You tell them about part of your day

or something about your
life, and they don't react.

They just have a stone face.

They don't say anything
or ask you a question,

that's not active listening,
so be sure to respond actively

to what they just said,

whether reflective statement
or a follow-up question.

Fourth, keep the focus on
them and let them talk.

Now this tip might seem obvious

because we're talking about listening,

but I wanna be clear about this

because it's one of the biggest
issues extroverted people

like me face when we're listening.

When you go into full listening mode,

just make a conscious decision

that this conversation is going

to be all about the other
person and not about you.

A common listening
pitfall, for example, is

that we get excited about what
the other person just said,

and then we jump in too
quickly with our own story

or something they said
reminds you of another issue

and you change the subject

before they're finished talking.

To keep the focus on them.

Make sure you're talking turns

and questions are both concise

and stick to whatever topic
they're interested in.

Of course, eventually, once
they've done plenty of talking,

there will usually be an opportunity later

in the conversation for you
to share your experiences,

and most cases, there'll be
plenty of time if your patient,

my rule-of-thumb is to dedicate
at least the first half

of the conversation to
pure active listening,

and if you're not sure how long
the conversation will last,

err on the side of
listening more than talking,

here's a summary of the two prerequisites

and the four active listening tips.

Again, the question for you is not,

do you understand these tips?

Knowing information is just the beginning.

The question for you is, are
you doing these consistently?

And tell me in the comments section, which

of these tips would make
the biggest improvement

in your listening?

As I mentioned, this is part
two in a four-part series,

part three, we'll explain the listening

for better comprehension.

Until next time, thanks.

God bless and I will see
you in the next video.
