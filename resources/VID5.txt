if you operate in the World of Sports or

education you've most likely heard of

the term growth mindset it's a concept

that's sweeping the world and changing

and improving the way that people learn

this powerful idea has been pushed

forward by Stanford professor and

bestselling author Carol dwick for

decades I've been studying why some

people succeed while people who are

equally talented do not and over the

years I've discovered that people's

mindsets play a crucial role in this

process these mindsets are really

important when it comes to learning her

work has uncovered two ways of thinking

about skill and development some people

have what's called a fixed mindset they

believe that skills and intelligence are

set and you either have them or you

don't that some people are just

naturally good at things While others

are not in short they believe that you

are not in control of your abilities

other people have what's called a growth

mindset and they believe that skills and

intelligence are grown and developed so

people who are good at something are

good because they built that ability and

people who aren't are not good because

they haven't done the work in short they

believe that you are in control of your

abilities really the core idea here is

people with a fixed mindset believe that

skills are born people with a growth

mindset believe that skills are built

people with a fixed mindset believe that

you can't or don't have to learn and

grow and people with a growth mindset do

believe in their capacity to learn and

grow DX's work shows that mindsets have

a major influence on people's ability to

learn and that people who utilize this

growth mindset tend to learn grow and

achieve more over time than people with

a

fixed

growth mindset really creates a solid

foundation for great learning and

because of its power companies sports

teams and schools from all over the

world are implementing this into their

[Music]

culture

[Music]

over the years we've worked with a ton

of amazing groups to help instill this

within their culture we're talking

Fortune 500 companies lots of colleges

lots of high schools and even a few

prisons who are working working to build

growth mindset into their re-entry

program what I'm trying to say is this

is bigger than one study or one Ted Talk

this is a powerful concept that's

helping lots of different people in lots

of different places now the reason it's

so important and Powerful is it is the

foundation for Learning and if you

understand this no matter what you build

on that Foundation it will be more

powerful but to really Implement and run

with this concept we need to zoom in and

look at the nuts and the the bolts of it

we need to talk about what it actually

is and how it actually works through

years of work D and her team have

uncovered sort of the defining

characteristics of the two mindsets this

table really illustrates the contrast

between the two the first big

characteristic we need to talk about is

belief again people with this fixed

mindset believe that skills are born and

therefore they can't or don't have to

learn people with a growth mindset

believe that skills are built therefore

they can learn the second major

characteristic is focus people in a

fixed mindset tend to focus on

performance and outcomes and results in

other words their main focus their main

concern becomes how they look and more

specifically to not look bad people with

a growth mindset tend to focus more on

the process of getting better of

learning and growing these mindsets and

these characteristics have a huge

influence on our ability to learn and

now we start to see why let's look at

like the four key ingredients to growth

effort challenges mistakes and

feedback the research shows that when

somebody is in a fixed mindset they look

at effort as a negative thing as

something that you do when you're not

good enough they also don't see the

value or purpose of putting an effort

they've been shown to back down and

avoid challenging situations they get

really discouraged and worked up when

they make mistakes and when somebody

with a fixed mindset receives feedback

from a parent a teacher a coach a friend

they defensive they take it personally

and they don't see the value or purpose

of the feedback so in other words people

with this fixed mindset actually avoid

and shy away from these four key

ingredients to growth DW Ander team have

shown that when people enter a growth

mindset they look at effort as a useful

thing as an important part of the

learning process they're actually more

likely to embrace challenges and

persevere and work through them they see

mistakes as learning opportunities and

when they receive feedback they actually

appreciate it and use

it now the fascinating and important

part of this table is to connect the

dots between these key characteristics

of the two mindsets and our actions and

behaviors towards learning let's look at

the fix mindset side first they actually

shy away from putting an effort because

they don't believe that they can change

they give up when they're met with a

challenge and things get hard because

they don't want to look bad so in their

mind the challenge becomes a threat

threat and because they don't believe

that they can change they hate making

mistakes and are discouraged by mistakes

because if you're making mistakes you're

not looking good and they don't see the

value or purpose of feedback because

they don't believe in their capacity to

grow so in one way or the other every

single one of these actions is a

byproduct of these characteristics and

the same is true on the growth mindset

side they see the value and purpose of

effort because they believe in their

capacity to grow they're more likely to

take on a challenge and persevere

through it because they believe that

they can grow and because they're

focused on the opportunity to do that so

they frame a challenge as an opportunity

to get better and by focusing on the

process and believing in their capacity

to grow they're more likely to

understand how important mistakes are in

this

process and when they receive feedback

from a parent teacher coach or friend

they're more receptive to this because

their focus is on getting better and

because they believe that that

information can help them grow and they

have the capacity to do so two key

points with this table first you're not

just one or the other this is a spectrum

and in different times on different days

in different situations you might be in

a growth well other times you'll slip

into a fix but now that we understand

how it works and we understand the

characteristics you can start to

identify where you're at on the Spectrum

and more specifically the cause of that

mindset is it our Bel beliefs or is it

our Focus second yes these actions of

learning are great and they're

definitely behaviors that we want but we

have to understand that they come from

our mindsets so to create a great

culture for learning it's about zooming

in on beliefs and focus and creating a

real growth mindset which is one of the

most important things we can

do
